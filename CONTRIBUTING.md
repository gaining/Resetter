The best way to contribute to this project is by submitting manifests and userlists of distros created with resetter helper. It is actually very easy to do so and does not require to learn any type of coding other than your time. You can also send me those files by email.

The best way to contribute to this project is by submitting manifests and userlists of distros created with resetter helper. It is actually very easy to do so and does not require to learn any type of coding other than your time. There are two ways to do this. One way is to make a pull request, you can find out how to make one from watching a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0wsPzO355o, the other is just to email me your manifest and userlist file and I'll add it to the repository.

# If you wish to contribute to other things...
Please check the issues list, there are some things to work on. If I like you work, I'll gladly merge them into my project. If I don't like it, don't take it personal, it just means that we have different views on the topic and I'd prefer to go my way.


# When creating other pull/merge requests
I'd prefer there to be a message to go with your commit as a comment preferably with some sort of intro detailing what your pull request is about in a courteous manner with good etiquette. If you're being rude, I'll just close it on the spot.

# Would like to contribute but don't know where to start?
Check the code and read it. I have written it so that it is easy for anyone to understand what goes on under the hood. Although there aren't many comments, the function names should give you the hint of what their jobs are. See the flow of my work and if you think your contribution is within my flow, don't hesitate to contact me and talk to me about it. I'm working on a different project, resetter-cli that runs terminally and is due to be released sometime this early November, it is built with python3 ncurses. I'm sure there will be many ways one could help once the initial alpha version is released.
